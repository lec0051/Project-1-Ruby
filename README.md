#### Short Answer

There were 8 short answer questions. I made a Powerpoint presentation and answered all 8 questions in that file. I then exported that file as a PDF. 
I also used screenshots of code that I wrote to give explanations to some of my answers.

#### Problem

The goal was to store a list of movies and keep the list updated with the most recent search, similar to how Google stores searches and 
uses the most recent search on top of their page. We used the main.rb and search_controller.rb files provided to us by our instructor
and then modified them.

___

#### Documentation

I created a repository for my project and then used the SAMPLE_README file provided to us as a guide.
Class SearchController
